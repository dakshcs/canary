## 10/18/2025 - came up with the idea  

okay so i live in delhi NCR in india and its diwali time rn which means that the air is super polluted and usually around this time i get a sore throat and i get sick too. i thought it would be really helpful if i had a sort of "canary" like miners used to have in the past that would alert them of oxygen deprivation.

so i think that a wearable/portable biohazard detector would be a nice to have. considering scales of economy and the ubiquitous availability of parts that could be used in such a project, i think it will be really cheap (~5k inr max) and so people will actually be able to buy it.

so a useful product, a functional product and a product that aims at saving people from health issues like lung cancer and general inconveniences like a sore throat. also i looked at a study that said that living in delhi is equivalent to smoking around 40 or so cigarettes per day and this could reduce your lifespan by up to 12 years.

as a kid who's lived in the NCR region for most of their life, i feel that i don't want others to face such problems. it also would help that considering evidence from this device, students could request a day off from school :)
